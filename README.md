# Transformers-Tensorflow-Chatbot

Transformers-Tensorflow-Chatbot is a deep learning application that leverages the power of Transformers and TensorFlow to create an intelligent chatbot. This project combines the sophisticated capabilities of Transformers for natural language understanding and TensorFlow for deep learning to provide an interactive and responsive conversational agent.

## Features

- **Transformer-based model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art Transformer architecture for natural language processing.
- **TensorFlow integration**: Built using TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks.
- **Flask web server**: Provides a simple web interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Pre-trained model**: Uses a pre-trained model for quick setup and deployment.
- **Customizable**: Easily fine-tune the model with your own dataset to cater to specific needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
- Flask 1.1 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Transformers-Tensorflow-Chatbot.git
   cd Transformers-Tensorflow-Chatbot

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use "venv\Scripts\activate"
  ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the chatbot.

# Customization

## Training the Model
To train the model with your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

2. Modify the model training script to load and preprocess your dataset.

3. Train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

### Updating the Flask Interface
To customize the web interface, edit the HTML template in templates/index.html and the CSS file in static/style.css.
